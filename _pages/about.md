I am an Assistant Professor of [Statistics and Data Science at Yale University](https://statistics.yale.edu/). My research interests span the intersection of machine learning, statistics, game theory, and optimization. 
In particular, I mainly work on the foundations of reinforcement learning, representation learning, and deep learning. 

Before coming to Yale, I worked as a postdoctoral researcher at the University of California, Berkeley, under the supervision of [Michael. I. Jordan](https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.00126). Prior to that, I obtained my Ph.D. from the Department of Operations Research and Financial Engineering at Princeton University, where I was co-advised by [Jianqing Fan](https://fan.princeton.edu/) and [Han Liu](http://magics.cs.northwestern.edu/index.html). I completed my bachelorâ€™s degree in Mathematics at Tsinghua University in 2015.
