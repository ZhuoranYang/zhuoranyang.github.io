I seek to develop a new generation of data-driven decision-making methods, theory, and systems, which tailor modern artificial intelligence towards addressing pressing societal challenges. To this end, my research aims at

(a) making deep reinforcement learning more efficient, both computationally and statistically, in a principled manner.

(b) scaling deep reinforcement learning to design and optimize societal-scale multi-agent systems, especially those involving cooperation and/or competition among a large population of humans and/or robots.
